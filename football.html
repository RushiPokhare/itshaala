    <p>A football match has two teams playing against each other.

        The number of players in each team should be a minimum of 7 and must not exceed 11.
        
        Four categories of players are there in a football match. Goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, and forwards.
        
        There must be one player designated as a goalkeeper in each team. If a goalkeeper is unavailable/suspended, any position player can become the designated goalkeeper.
        
        Each team is led by a captain, whose one official responsibility is to represent the team at the coin toss before the kick-off or penalty kicks.
        
        Winning the coin toss means your team gets to choose the initial direction of play. The direction of both teams switches after half time before the second half starts. The team that loses the toss does the first kick-off and starts.</p>
